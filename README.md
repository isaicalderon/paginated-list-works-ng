# Frontend Coding Exercise using Crossref

We would like you to build a small web application displaying job listings using Angular (version 8 or higher).

You have complete creative control over how the web app looks and functions.

Once you have completed this exercise, please answer the follow up questions below. Be sure to save your answers in a single markdown file named FOLLOW-UP.md and send your recruiter a link to the Github repository.
